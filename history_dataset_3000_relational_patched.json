The rise of the Harappan Civilization was supported by fertile river valleys, agricultural surplus, and trade networks. Technological skills in urban planning and craft production helped sustain large settlements. River systems and regional exchange connected different Harappan centres. The Harappan Civilization is significant for representing the first major urbanization in the Indian subcontinent.
